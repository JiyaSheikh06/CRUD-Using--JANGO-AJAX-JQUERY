# Django CRUD with Ajax and jQuery

This repository provides a sample CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Django, Ajax, and jQuery. It showcases how to implement asynchronous interactions with the server using Ajax and jQuery to perform CRUD operations without refreshing the page.

## Key Features

- **Create**: Add new tasks to the application by submitting a form asynchronously.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display a list of tasks from the server without page reload.
- **Update**: Edit and update the status of existing tasks with real-time updates.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the application using Ajax requests.

## Technologies Used

- Django: A Python web framework for building robust web applications.
- Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, used to perform server-side requests without page refresh.
- jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library for simplifying client-side scripting.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-crud-ajax-jquery.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd django-crud-ajax-jquery
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Apply database migrations:

   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the CRUD application.
